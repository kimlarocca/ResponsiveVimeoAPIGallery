# ResponsiveVimeoAPIGallery

Hi!

This is a simple example of how to use the Vimeo Simple API, which I have modified from the original found at https://github.com/vimeo/vimeo-api-examples/tree/master/simple-api/simple in order to make it responsive / mobile-friendly.

All you need to do is change the vimeoUserName variable to your username and upload to your server.

For more documentation on the API go to http://www.vimeo.com/api
